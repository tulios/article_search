And you're like a 90's jesus
And you revel in your psychosis
How dare you...
And you sample concepts like hors d'euvres
And you eat their questions for dessert
and is it just me or is it hot in here

And you're like a 90's kennedy
And you're really a million years old
You can't fool me
They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites
and is it just me or is it dark in here?

Well you may never be or have a husband,
you may never have or hold a child.
You will learn to lose everything,
we are temporary arrangements.

And you're like a 90's noah
And they laughed at you as
you packed all of your things
And they wonder why you're frustrated
And they wonder why you're so angry
And is it just me or are you fed up?

"...And may god bless you in your travels in your conquests and queries..."
