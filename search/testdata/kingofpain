There's A Little Black Spot On The Sun Today
It's The Same Old Thing As Yesterday
There's A Black Hat Caught In A High Tree Top
There's A Flag Pole Rag And The Wind Won't Stop

I Have Stood Here Before Inside The Pouring Rain
With The World Turning Circles Running 'round My Brain
I Guess I'm Always Hoping That You'll End This Reign
But It's My Destiny To Be The King Of Pain

There's A Fossil That's Trapped In A High Cliff Wall
(that's my soul up there)
There's A Dead Salmon Frozen In A Waterfall
(that's my soul up there)
There's A Blue Whale Beached By A Springtide's Ebb
That's my soul up there)
There's A Butterfly Trapped In A Spider's Web

I Have Stood Here Before Inside The Pouring Rain
With The World Turning Circles Running 'round My Brain
I Guess I'm Always Hoping That You'll End This Reign
But It's My Destiny To Be The King Of Pain

There's A King On A Throne With His Eyes Torn Out
There's A Blind Man Looking For A Shadow Of Doubt
There's A Rich Man Sleeping On A Golden Bed
There's A Skeleton Choking On A Crust Of Bread

There's A Red Fox Torn By A Huntsman's Pack
There's A Black Winged Gull With A Broken Back
There's A Little Black Spot On The Sun Today
It's The Same Old Thing As Yesterday

I Have Stood Here Before Inside The Pouring Rain
With The World Turning Circles Running 'round My Brain
I Guess I Always Hoping That You Will End This Reign
But It's My Destiny To Be The Queen Of Pain

I'll Always Be Queen Of Pain
